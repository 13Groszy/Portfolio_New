<p>My name is Mateusz and I live in Yeovil, small town in United Kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p>After discovering many paths of working with the code I can finally
call myself a self-taught web developer who focus mainly on front
end.</p>
<p>My target in creating websites is keen eye for detail, being original and
thinking outside of the box.</p>
<br>
<p>My actual stack (6/2022) is HTML, CSS, SCSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, Vue.js.</p>
